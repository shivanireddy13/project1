# The Decolonisation of India's Map
This project visualizes cities in India that have been renamed post-independence. 

## Summary 
Most name changes happened under the Indian National Congress government, immediately post-independence. My home state, infact, Karnataka, is in the lead here, with 12 name changes. 

## Data Collection
I used WebScraper to scrape [this Wikipedia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaming_of_cities_in_India) of renamed Indian cities to compile a list of their old names and new, and the year their name was changed and the local political party was in power at the time. 

## Analysis
I used pandas and Microsoft Excel to conduct preliminary analysis and clean up the data. Then I used DataWrapper to visualize it. 

## Tools used (and skills gained)

## What I could've done better
I was hoping to delve into the specific reason some names were changed, and represent which syllables were changed the most often, which is, which ones the British changed the most because they found the hardest to pronounce using Big-Phoney. I still hope to, so technically this project is still a work-in-progress.
