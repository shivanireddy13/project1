# The Decolonisation of India's Map
This project visualizes cities in India that have been renamed post-independence. 

# Summary Most name changes happened under the Indian National Congress government, immediately post-independence. My home state, infact, Karnataka, is in the lead here, with 12 name changes.

# What I could've done better
I was hoping to delve into the specific reason some names were changed, and represent which syllables were changed the most often, which is, which ones the British changed the most because they found the hardest to pronounce using Big-Phoney. I still hope to, so technically this project is still a work-in-progress.
