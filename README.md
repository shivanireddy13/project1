# The Decolonization of India's Map
This project visualizes cities in India that have been renamed post-independence in 1947. 

## Summary 
Most name changes happened under the Indian National Congress government, immediately post-independence. My home state, infact, Karnataka, is in the lead here, with 12 name changes, but all of these happened much after independence in 2007, under the Janata Dal Party. 

## Data Collection
I used WebScraper to scrape [this Wikipedia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaming_of_cities_in_India) of renamed Indian cities to compile a list of their old names and new, and the year their name was changed and the local political party that was in power at the time. 

## Analysis
I used pandas and Microsoft Excel to conduct preliminary analysis and clean up the data. Then I used DataWrapper to visualize it.

## What I could've done better
I was hoping to delve into the specific reason some names were changed, and represent which syllables were changed the most often, which is, which ones the British changed the most because they found the hardest to pronounce using Big-Phoney, a python library that does syllable analysis. I still hope to, so technically this project is still a work-in-progress.
