Data downloaded for kaggle.com in order to map the data in ArcGIS I need to split the column named lactation as this is the lat and long. Below is code to slit and rename the new columns. 
```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(splitstackshape)
library(plyr)
setwd("/Users/jeffkropelnicki/Documents/R_codes/kaggle/top_indian_cities")
```

load data   
```{r}
indiancities <- read.csv("/Users/jeffkropelnicki/Documents/R_codes/kaggle/top_indian_cities/cities_r2.csv")
```

create two columns for the location column.    
```{r}
Updated_indiancities <- cSplit(indiancities, "location", ",", stripWhite = FALSE)
```   
   
Rename the new columns   
```{r}
Indian_Cities <- rename(Updated_indiancities, c("location_1" = "latitude", "location_2" = "longitude" ))
```   
save to .csv
```{r}
write.csv(Indian_Cities, file = "Indian_Cities.csv")
```
